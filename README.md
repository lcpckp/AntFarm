# Ant Simulator

Right Click to create a food source (starts with 3000 food)

Left Click to spawn 50 ants.

Haven't implemented a lot of features yet so you need to spawn the ants starting on the home circle in the middle of the screen. Clicking elsewhere will lead the ants to the wrong destination.

Ant.cpp - the constructor contains a lot of the ants trail following and sampling settings.
