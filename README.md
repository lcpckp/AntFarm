Will add more of a description when it's fleshed out but here are the basic controls:

Click - spawn ants - controlled by the spawnClick variable in Resources.h
Right click - spawn a food source

Ant.cpp - the constructor contains a lot of the ants settings, they are set to bogus values right now for testing purposes

The ants don't follow the trails right now, but that's what I'm currently working on.
